<h2> Have you ever wondered how to make a facial detection software but was a bit intimidated by the technical jargon posted on the internet ? </h2>
<h2> Or have you simply wanted to make one but dont't have the time and neccessary experience to go about it ? </h2> 

<h2>Worry no more as this project is designed with all these in mind :) </h2>

<h2> Let's get started</h2>
<h5>1. Install Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> </h5>
<h5>2. Install any Python IDE of your choice <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments">here</a> </h5>
<h5>3. Install the packages using a simple command  by opening a command prompt in "your python installed folder/scripts/" after downloading this repository </h5>
<h6>pip install -r requirements.txt </h6>
<h5>4. Copy any image that you want to do face detection and put that URL in the code </h5>
<h5>5. Run the code </h5>
<h3> NOTE: </h3>
<h4> There will be some loss in image quality in the output as the original image is compressed internally to do face detection without a GPU using Open CV </h4> 
<h4> In order to mitigate this and to a extent do face detection without false positives, please use a high resolution photo as your input </h4>

<h3> Additional information </h3>
<h4> If you have experience in working with packages and exporting modules in Python, you can export this code as a module in your project </h4>
