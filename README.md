<h1>FaceUpÂ® : Face Detection for Beginners </h1>
<h2> An easy to implement project on Face Detection made using Python3,OpenCV and Matplotlib without the use of GPU* and with a accuracy of around 85% for images with less than 6 subjects in frame and 70% for more than 6 subjects when considered factors like resolution, exposure of image, linear seperation between subjects and a viable updated model present in Open CV</h2>

<h6> *If a GPU satisfying passable conditions for image recognition is present, a additional library called Tensorflow may be asked to install </h6>

<h2> Let's get started</h2>
<h5>1. Install Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> </h5>
<h5>2. Install any Python IDE of your choice <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments">here</a> </h5>
<h5>3. Install the packages using a simple command  by opening a command prompt in "your python installed folder/scripts/" after downloading this repository </h5>
<h6>pip install -r requirements.txt </h6>
<h5>4. Put the image URL that you want to do face detection in the code </h5>
<h5>5. Run the code </h5>
<h3> NOTE: </h3>
<h4>=> As you might have noticed,there will be some loss in image quality in the output as the original image is compressed internally to do face detection due to which the faces might look like Na'vi from Avatar </h4> 
<h4>=> For computers its all about RGB(Red Green Blue) composition in each frame which is broken down into multiple subframes like a matrix and the computer processes it 1 by one so thats why I had to show how it works in the output </h4>
<h4>=> For real-time image recognition, this project can help you get started by helping to know what face detection is all about</h4>

<h3> Additional information </h3>
<h4> If you are comfortable in making and exporting packages then you can consider this face detection module as one as export it to yoyr project as a standalone module for image recognition</h4>
