<h2> An easy to implement project on Face Detection made using Python3,OpenCV and Matplotlib without the use of GPU* and with a accuracy of around 85% for images with less than 6 subjects in frame and 70% for more than 6 subjects when considered factors like resolution, exposure of image, linear seperation between subjects and a viable updated model present in Open CV that can do all of this based on user's system specification</h2>

<h6> *If a GPU satisfying passable conditions for image recognition is present, a additional library called Tensorflow may be asked to install </h6>

<h2> Let's get started</h2>
<h5>1. Install Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> </h5>
<h5>2. Install any Python IDE of your choice <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments">here</a> </h5>
<h5>3. Install the packages using a simple command  by opening a command prompt in "your python installed folder/scripts/" after downloading this repository </h5>
<h6>pip install -r requirements.txt </h6>
<h5>4. Put the image URL that you want to do face detection in the code </h5>
<h5>5. Run the code </h5>
<h3> NOTE: </h3>
<h4> There will be some loss in image quality in the output as the original image is compressed internally to do face detection without a GPU using Open CV due to which the faces might look like Na'vi from Avatar </h4> 
<h4> In order to mitigate this and to a extent do face detection without false positives, please use a high resolution photo as your input </h4>

<h3> Additional information </h3>
<h4> If you have experience in working with packages and exporting modules in Python, you can export this code as a module in your project </h4>
